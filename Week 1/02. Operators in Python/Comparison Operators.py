'''
Comparison Operators: Comparison operators are used to compare two values. Python supports the following comparison operators:

* Equal to (==): Returns True if the operands are equal.

* Not equal to (!=): Returns True if the operands are not equal.

* Greater than (>): Returns True if the first operand is greater than the second.

* Less than (<): Returns True if the first operand is less than the second.

* Greater than or equal to (>=): Returns True if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.

* Less than or equal to (<=): Returns True if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.
