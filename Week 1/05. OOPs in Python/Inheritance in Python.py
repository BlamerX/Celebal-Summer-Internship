'''
Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to be based on an existing class. The new class, called the derived class or subclass, inherits the properties and methods of the existing class, called the base class or superclass. This allows the derived class to reuse code from the base class and add new functionality as needed.

# define a superclass
class super_class:
    # attributes and method definition
    # inheritance
    pass


class sub_class(super_class):
    # attributes and method of super_class
    # attributes and method of sub_class
    pass
